    headline: 'What is Universal Reason?',
    content: [
      `Universal reason is a framework of thought founded by some of the first philosophers, which when embraced translates into a lifestyle that optimizes the human experience, simply because of its pure agreeance with natural cosmic order.`,
      `The term 'universal reason' was coined in 300 B.C. by the Stoics, a collective of thinkers in Athens, Greece who initiated a new wave of philosophical thought with a distinct emphasis on virtue. By questioning the fundamental intentions of man and his relationship to the natural and supernatural, we can gain knowledge of the laws of reality and build sound principles that enable us to visualize a society and way of life for man that is lastingly pleasant. "To live in accordance with nature" is the main theme of universal reason, which implies the wisdom we can gain is more than just factual knowledge, it is an underlying structure of thinking that we can manually apply to improve many aspects of our lives. The purpose of man is to live in accordance with nature, the Stoics concluded, and when done successfully this results in a happier, more meaningful life.`,
      `Reason, much like nature in the scope of philosophy, is a complex topic with multiple interpretations. On one hand, it is defined as the cause of natural events, often on a cosmic scale. On the other, it refers to a mental capability unique to man that allows him to develop keen insight of the natural world and himself through rationality. Reason is universal due to its unchanging influence in the objective universe; when man reasons he is aiming to form an equally solid understanding of the truth, of the event. Furthermore, to live with reason is to live with rationality, which equips man with the discernment to master himself and his relationship to the universe, by taking action with conscious intentions backed with intuitive logic.`,
      `Objective reality is what we find when we reason, as this is the pillar upon on which knowledge itself stands. A most common example is 2+2 = 4. The basics of mathematics are universal truths of conceptual abstraction that permeate existence, and man became aware of this, through reason itself. The mind of man was formed by the same reason that formed the cosmos, but unlike other species, he has a heightened sense of awareness which is built to investigate this reason, making him peculiarly intertwined with it. Through the scientific, deepening our understanding of objective reality has always been and will always be a vital part of our progress as a species. At the next level, we ask questions about how to use it to better navigate the contrasting vital element of the spiritual-- how to view and treat self, one another, and world.`,
      `Kagwave is inventing products and designs inspired by universal reason, and in the process developing the historic movement further by researching the intracacies of its history, as well as asking new questions that are relevant to the workings of modern and future civilizations.`

      `The human race has reached a critical inflection point in which it will soon be forced to reflect and think about its intentions with every step going forward. In a time full of self-created, self-fulfilling paradoxes, man has found himself going through the motions without any true certainty or direction, and in turn living the same day, every day.`,
      `Due to modern web technology, we now live in an age of free information, which is immediately accessible at our very fingertips. This, in addition to the social mediums that enable connection with the world at large in real-time, has caused an expansion in the baseline awareness of man. However, the underlying systems of society have yet to adapt to this newfound awareness. The education system has remained the same as it ever was, as if the only path to knowledge is still through paperback books carefully gatekeeped by decorated scholars. Workers are still slaving in monotonous tasks for long hours and low wages, much similarly to the facilities of previous eras of time.`,
      `Despite the system being behind, certain limitations have been broken down and people now have widespread access to the tools that can allow them to pursue what can bring out the best in themselves. This is what we should encourage as a speciesâ€” a society based on individuals and their innate desires. When we acknowledge and appreciate the individual for their unique energy and ability, or deeper desire to develop one, instead of their ability to fit a prescribed mold, this creates a naturally diverse, but more importantly, naturally functional society. Because of the lack of force required and the fact that this begins internally, this manner of operating encourages people to do their best and play their part without needing much external reinforcement, and so they reach new heights along the way.`,
      `If 'living in accordance with nature' is the purpose of man, this is how we can begin. You cannot ask stone to behave and perform like wood, because each has its own biological makeup and purpose within the larger system of nature. We can look to the system of nature as an analogy or blueprint as to how human society should operate. When we become dedicated to discovering, creating, and living our individual purpose, fitting the smaller pieces into the bigger puzzle of the world becomes, well, second nature.`,
      `If evolution is a simulation, humanity is still in the early stages. The destination is a civilization that functions as seamlessly smooth as the interconnected systems of nature.`,
